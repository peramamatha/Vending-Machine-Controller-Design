## Overall Learning 

>During the Integrated VLSI Designing Internship, I worked through the complete semiconductor design flow starting from CMOS fundamentals to physical and analog layout implementation. I designed and tested digital modules using Verilog and performed verification using SystemVerilog and UVM. I developed a theoretical understanding of DFT concepts, STA methodologies, and physical design (PD) processes such as timing closure and layout optimization. This experience improved my ability to debug real design issues, follow industry workflows, and contribute effectively to chip development tasks.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project">Project : Vending Machine Controller Using Verilog HDL </h3>
<p>
  This project involved designing a Vending Machine Controller by translating the provided specification into a structured RTL implementation. The work focused on defining configuration, managing input handling, executing item selection, and generating corresponding outputs, while maintaining a clear and modular design approach for effective integration. This process enhanced my practical understanding of hardware design principles and strengthened my ability to implement functional requirements in a systematic and organized manner.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
> Through the Life Skill Sessions, I learned to manage tasks with better time planning, adapt to challenges with a positive mindset, and work more confidently in team environments. The Soft Skill Sessions helped me improve my communication, presentation, and professional interaction skills, enabling me to express ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. Together, these sessions strengthened my overall personal and professional development, contributing to better confidence, discipline, and workplace readiness.
